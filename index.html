				Hello you have reached the website for Tryngul Industrial Solutions Worldwide International Business Conglomorate of Many Good Things and Products That Are All Guaranteed
				this is the CEO speaking how may I direct your call we have a large variety of many good things that you may be interersted in hearing about or maybe purchasing our prices
				are all very good i think you will be happy with what we have and what we are celling i mean i should know i am the CEO and i would know right yeah that's right you don't just 
				wake up and become a cEO one day its hard hard work don't let any one say otherwise because there lying i work hard every day i wake up and eat my breakfast and then liek walk
				around and stuff and talk to people sometimes they need something or sometimes not and then you have to look at a bunch of powerpoint slides and sometimes you need to make a 
				powerpoint but you dont really do that yourself you get soemone else to make it but you still have to review it and say the words for it that they write for you in the margins
				and sometimes thats a lot of words like sometimes you have to talk and talk and talk and your mouth gets all dry and you have to take a sip of the water cup or sometimes you 
				have coffee in your cup but i dont really like coffee it is a bit too sour for my tastes but then when your done with the powerpoint presentation and your mouth is all dry You
				still need to do some work can you believe it like sometimes you have to write emails or read emails or figure out what words everyone else is saying so that you can say those
				same words to everyone and be all like "are we focusing on X enough?" and "i think we should prioritize X more" where X is the word that everyone else is saying and you know what
				that means yes you do its more talking and more thristy and dry mouth but don't drink that coffee like i said its very sour and a bad idea
				ok now read that back to me siri ok

				better than you at everything so just give up and he definitely knows how to use punctuation no matter what brenda says. see, there was a period there, BRENDA. if You
				are reading this, BRENDA, you are fired. But enough about stupid brenda, let's talk about <s>me</s> The Mouse. The Mouse graduated from every prestiguous university in the world ever
				with a major in Counting and a minor in Guarding. He then traveled to the United States because he wanted to and not because he was on the run from the law and accidently fell into a shipping crate.
				He spent years working guarding jobs and fighting ninjas until he finally got a job at the most best american institution: The Depot. He was the best at lawnmower sales EVER. He acquired a wealth of honor and became even more famous and
				everybody loved him. He left The Depot because he wanted to, and no other reason. At this point he established his own mega-corporation that is prophosized to one day take total control of the world,
				rendering all other existing corporations, governments, and societal structures obsolete. He called this corporation...TRYNGUL INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS WORLDWIDE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONGLOMERATE OF MANY GOOD THINGS AND
